## Methodology

My audit process follows a rigorous methodology:

1. **Scoping & Reconnaissance** - Understanding the protocol design, purpose, and architecture
2. **Static Analysis** - Automated scanning with industry-standard and custom tools
3. **Manual Code Review** - Line-by-line examination with pattern recognition and vulnerability assessment
4. **Dynamic Testing** - Custom exploit development and proof-of-concept verification
5. **Reporting & Communication** - Clear documentation and actionable remediation guidance
6. **Verification** - Confirming that implemented fixes properly address identified vulnerabilities
