## About This Repository

Welcome to my security research portfolio. This repository documents my learning journey in smart contract security, containing practice assessments, security research, and educational resources I've created while developing my skills in blockchain security.

I'm currently building expertise in smart contract auditing through systematic study, practice assessments, and participation in audit contests. This repository serves as both a learning log and a demonstration of my growing capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm actively learning and improving my security assessment skills. The assessments here represent my current understanding and approach to security analysis. I welcome feedback and collaboration opportunities!

## Learning Focus

- 🔎 **Smart Contract Vulnerability Analysis** - Identifying and understanding common vulnerabilities in EVM contracts
- 📚 **Security Best Practices** - Researching and implementing industry standards for secure contract development
- 🛠️ **Audit Methodology Development** - Building a systematic approach to security assessments
- 🧪 **Testing Techniques** - Exploring effective verification methods for security properties

## Assessment Portfolio

| Project | Type | Date | Purpose | Report |
|---------|------|------|---------|--------|
| InheritableSmartContractWallet | Practice Assessment | March 2025 | Learning exercise | [Report](./reviews/2025-03-13-inherited-wallet/2025-03-13-inheritable-smart-contract-wallet.pdf) |
| PasswordStore | Practice Review | March 2025 | Skill development | [Report](./reviews/2025-03-09-password-store/2025-03-09-password-store-audit.pdf) |

## My Approach

As I develop my security assessment skills, I'm building a methodical process:

1. **Understanding the Code** - Taking time to thoroughly comprehend protocol functionality and design intent
2. **Static Analysis** - Using automated tools to identify potential vulnerabilities
3. **Manual Code Review** - Systematically reviewing code for security issues
4. **Verification** - Testing findings with proof-of-concept examples when possible
5. **Clear Documentation** - Practicing clear, actionable security reporting
