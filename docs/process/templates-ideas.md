Here are several additional templates you could create to further enhance your security audit workflow:

1. **Vulnerability Database Template** - A structured format for cataloging vulnerabilities you find across multiple audits, helping you build your own knowledge base and pattern recognition

2. **Client Onboarding Questionnaire** - A standardized set of questions to gather essential information about a new project before beginning an audit

3. **Audit Scope Definition Template** - A formal document outlining exactly what is and isn't included in your audit, preventing scope creep

4. **Finding Prioritization Matrix** - A framework for consistently ranking vulnerabilities based on multiple factors beyond just impact and likelihood

5. **Common Vulnerability Checklist by Contract Type** - Specialized checklists for different types of contracts (DEXs, lending protocols, NFT marketplaces, etc.)

6. **Gas Optimization Findings Template** - A standardized format for documenting gas optimizations with benchmarks and savings estimates

7. **Test Coverage Analysis Template** - A structured approach to evaluating and reporting on the quality and completeness of a project's test suite

8. **Smart Contract Security Posture Summary** - A visual dashboard-style report showing the overall security posture of a protocol

9. **Remediation Verification Checklist** - A process for confirming that vulnerabilities have been properly addressed after fixes are implemented

10. **Protocol-Specific Attack Scenario Database** - Templates for constructing and evaluating attack scenarios tailored to different protocol architectures

11. **Competitor/Similar Protocol Risk Analysis** - A framework for analyzing comparable protocols to identify potential vulnerability patterns

12. **Follow-up Audit Template** - A streamlined process for conducting subsequent audits of the same protocol after initial findings have been addressed

Each of these templates could be valuable additions to your security audit toolkit, depending on your specific workflow and client needs.
