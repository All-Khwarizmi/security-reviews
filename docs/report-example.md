# Protocol Summary

[REPLACE WITH PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION]

# Disclaimer

The Cura team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

This report is not to be considered as financial or investment advice.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

## Impact

- **High Impact**: Funds can be directly or nearly directly stolen, frozen, or otherwise negatively affected. The protocol can't properly function after the vulnerability is exploited.
- **Medium Impact**: A vulnerability that could affect the protocol's intended functionality, but does not directly lead to fund loss. The effects are contained.
- **Low Impact**: A vulnerability with minimal impact on protocol functionality or security, often localized to a specific function.

## Likelihood

- **High Likelihood**: The vulnerability is easy to exploit and/or has limited prerequisites.
- **Medium Likelihood**: The vulnerability has specific preconditions but is still reasonably exploitable.
- **Low Likelihood**: The vulnerability has complex and hard-to-achieve prerequisites or requires specific timing/conditions.

# Audit Methodology

The audit process employed a multi-faceted approach to ensure thorough coverage of potential vulnerabilities:

## Static Analysis

The following static analysis tools were used to identify potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues:

- **Slither**: For identifying common Solidity issues and security vulnerabilities
- **Mythril**: For symbolic execution and identification of potential exploits
- **Solhint**: For Solidity code style and best practices enforcement

## Manual Review

Manual code review followed a systematic approach:

1. **Architecture review**: Analyzing the overall system design and interaction between contracts
2. **Business logic review**: Validating that implementations correctly follow the intended protocol design
3. **Function-by-function review**: Detailed examination of each function's implementation
4. **State transitions analysis**: Identifying potential issues in how contract state changes
5. **Access control verification**: Ensuring proper permission systems are in place
6. **Error handling analysis**: Verifying appropriate error handling and edge case management

## Test Coverage

The codebase was analyzed for test coverage using:

- **Unit tests**: To verify individual function behavior
- **Integration tests**: To verify interactions between components
- **Fuzzing**: To identify edge cases using randomized inputs
- **Invariant testing**: To verify properties that must always hold true
